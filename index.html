  <h1>MANSI</h1>
  <p>
    <em>student studying ECE at <strong>manipal university jaipur</strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Mansi is a very determined student who thinks having some free time is a crime. she constantly worries about being productive
    which also has its benefits, but leads to burnouts and hairfall. she also tends to rely on academic validation too much and she has high
    expectations for herself. shes also strong headed sometimes and thinks everything will eventually turn her way and when it doesnt,
    she gets very disappointed. it doesnt show, but Mansi really cares about her people. she becomes truly attached and she becomes lowkey possessive.
    Mansi is ever growing and changing and is probably analysing her personality and how she should alter it right now.
